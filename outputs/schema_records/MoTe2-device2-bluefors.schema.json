  "title": "Superconducting Diode Effect in a 2L-MoTe2 Device",
  "description": "Extensive electrical transport study of a dual-gated 2-layer MoTe2 device (#2) at cryogenic temperatures in a Bluefors dilution refrigerator. The measurements focus on characterizing the superconducting state and investigating the superconducting diode effect. The experiment involves detailed sweeps of temperature (down to 50mK), magnetic field (in-plane Hx, Hy and out-of-plane Hz), back gate voltage (Vbg), and DC bias current (Idc). Key measurements include resistance vs. temperature and field, differential resistance (dI/dV or dV/dI) vs. DC bias, and field-dependent critical currents, revealing asymmetric transport and Josephson junction-like interference patterns.",
