  "description": "Fabrication details and initial low-temperature electrical transport measurements of a twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2) device (D2). The device features a complex multi-gated structure with top, bottom, and contact gates. Preliminary dual-gate transport measurements at 4K and 10mK under a small magnetic field (0.2T) show very high contact resistance. The presentation also documents the fabrication process and notes potential issues such as cracks in the flake and discrepancies in the expected gate dielectric thicknesses.",
