  "title": "WSe2 Sensor for Probing Twisted Graphene States",
  "description": "Investigation of an AB-BA stacked graphene device (D2) using a monolayer WSe2 flake as a local optical sensor. The WSe2 is in direct contact with the graphene. The study employs scanning photoluminescence (PL) and differential reflectance (dR/R) at 4K to probe the graphene's electronic states. By measuring the gate-dependent optical response of the WSe2 sensor, the experiment aims to detect features corresponding to the underlying graphene's properties, such as insulating states at integer fillings (nu=-4) and potential spin-polarized 'halo' regions. Polarization-resolved measurements are also performed to probe for energy splittings in the WSe2 1s exciton state.",
