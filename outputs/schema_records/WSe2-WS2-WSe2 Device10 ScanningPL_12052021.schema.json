  "description": "Scanning photoluminescence (PL) and differential reflectance (dR/R) study of a WSe2-WS2-WSe2 heterostructure (Device 10) at 6K. The experiment investigates the gate-dependent optical properties of both bilayer and trilayer regions, focusing on interlayer excitons (IX). Moiré wavelength is estimated from the data, and the IX energy is analyzed.",
