  "title": "Magnetotransport in a Dual-Gated Bilayer CrSBr Device",
  "description": "Extensive magnetotransport investigation of a dual-gated bilayer CrSBr device (D1). The study explores the electrical properties (Rxx, Rxy) as a function of temperature (23K, 60K), dual-gate voltages (carrier density and electric field), and magnetic field (strength and orientation). Key observations include strong magnetoresistance (MR) with hysteresis, gate-tunable insulating states, and significant magnetic anisotropy revealed by in-plane field rotation. The data shows a gate-tunable sign change in the MR, possibly indicating a weak localization to weak anti-localization transition, and characteristic 'bunny ear' features in the Hall resistance.",

I increased range for temperature dependence, but didn’t decrease again. Will check tomorrow to make sure (locked out tonight). Also, based on this plot and previous slide, it seems we are close to something more drastic happening.
