  "description": "Electrical characterization of a MoTe2-WSe2 heterostructure device (D2). The device was fabricated using a shadow mask for Pt contacts and subsequent Cr/Au evaporation. Two-probe I-V curves were measured at room temperature (300K) and low temperature (2K) under various gate voltage conditions.",
